# KongenPaHaugenFestival

In this project I could make any website i wanted to.

I chose to make a website for my own imaginary festival.

The project is using Sanity, and retrieve data from this external source.

The project gives you:
- Frontpage (some stuff is from Sanity)
- Aboutpage (from Sanity)
- Programpage (from Sanity)
- Artistspage (from Sanity)
- Ticketspage (from Sanity)
- Contactpage (from Sanity)

I have also added some animations and some vue, like slideshow.
